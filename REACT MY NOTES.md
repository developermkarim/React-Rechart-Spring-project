# REACT JS

## React learning path;

Four types of components in React;

1. Similar in look but different in data.
2. Container components where one or more similar components are contained in border catagory.
3. keeping components in beakdown system for sakeness of work in website.
   Example : left site or right side of a page.best example in www.thejsdude.com(right side) and left side in www.youtube.com in desktop.
4. alone components not like the above components e.g. footer section or header section is stand alone component.

SIngle Page application(SPA) vs Multi Page application(MPA)

1.SPA --Quick Loading time but MPA - slow Loading time. 2. Uses Less Bandwidth but MPA- more Bandwidth.
3.SPA has Seamless/ good User Experience but MPA - less good User Experience. 4. SPA is something securtiy essue but MPA - has securtiy strong. 5. SPA Doesn't Perform well with SEO but MPA - Performs well with search Engine Optimization.

// Single Page application has a ROUNTING option .Depending on Routing , We can see the option of Page.
it enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

// Attributes vs properties.
actually The Attributes used in html are named properties in using for javscript.suppose dom properties but html Attributes title, id, href.

// properties calls as PROPS in React.

// user can change STATE in web app(React state). if user interact in app , state can be changed.if totally depends on user. If He doesn't change state, Suppose visiting in app ,he doesn't apply any react like in facebook.add to card in ecommerce is a state changing example.to Wrap up, Web Application data that could be changed.

### 6 Core Concepts of ReactJS to UnderStant Easily

1.JSX == Javacript objects.It is system for writing html.its Babble takes html codes and convert it to javscript.
we can use style in 3 ways internal , external and inline in JSX.(app.js). JSX(Javacript Xml)

// JSX----

// 2. useState() // used for creating new state in website like increasing product count or add to product.It has [] empty array with 2 elements . one is counter value and the other is function for the counter. So we can destructering

this array const [count, SetCount] = useState()

and afftecting for this state useEffect(arrow function , array[]) with these two parts

///

const ExternalUsers = ()=>{

const [users, setUsers] = useState([])
useEffect(()=>{
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
.then(res => res.json())
.then(resData => setUsers(resData))
},

[]);

///

/// 3. components
/// 4. Props.(Attributes for HTML but properties for React)
/// 5. Dynamic creating function <functionNme></functionNme>
/// 6. Events

return result with (

import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

const myInfo = {name:'Mahmodul Karim', age: 27, graduate: 'Masters'}
const {name, age, graduate} = myInfo;
const myPhoneNumber = '0164721332';
const myWorking = 'Learning Programming';
const myaddress = 'Lalbag Thana, Dhaka South Area, code-1381';

const myWorkingStyle ={
color:'violet',
backgroundColor:'#61dafb',
padding:'20px',
margin : '10px'
}

function App() {
return (

<div className="App">
<header className="App-header">
<img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />

    <h1>JSX</h1>
    <p className='welcomeMsg'>Hellow Dude , React , How R You</p>
    <h3>Name : {name}</h3> <span>{graduate}</span>

   <p style={{color:'black', backgroundColor:'yellow'}}>My Contact Number : {`+88-${myPhoneNumber}`}</p>
   <p>My Learning Way : {myWorking}</p>
   <address>My Location : {mydress}</address>

        <p style={myWorkingStyle}>
          Edit the source <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>

      </header>
    </div>

);
}

export default App;

---- creating new Folder name component in src folder.Then js , css and other working files including here.

)
two important extension of VS code.

// React extension pack for shortcut snippet , such as rsc mean full function with name and export.

// creating a React component like from API
Methods Here : 1. useState([]) ,

2.  useEffect( () =>{}, [])

3.  Fething data in the useEffect arrow function.

4.  working with map or others in return(
  <div> 
  </div>
  and calling here the fucntion that used to show data
)

5.  Makeanother function to show data easily and clearly with giving properties that used in main function html tag Attributes inside(e.g. name) these < name= {}> </>.

// Properties(html tag in js) can be taken in a variable to use direct function . no need to use propeties one by one in calling function <></> in this ways.

example

{
EachCountry.slice(0,20).map(EachCountryData => <Country // best way this to use all props.
country_data = {EachCountryData}

                //  CountryName = {EachCountryData.name.common} |
                //  Population = {EachCountryData.population}    | all these previous sytem to use properties
                //   Area = {EachCountryData.area}

               ></Country>)

           }

           more useful system .
           example by using directly destructering

Example Here :

const Country = (props) => {
const {name:{common},area, population} = props.country_data;
return (

<div>
<h4 className='countryStyle'>Country name : {common}</h4>
<h5>Population : {population}</h5>
<h6>AREA : {area}</h6>
</div>
);
};

           and finally the best way to use and call the propeties

// React app to deploy in netlify -- npm run build writing in VS Code terminal or cmd.then After every updates , npm run build is mandatory to write in terminal.it will build in same project folder in my app.

## To use Bootstrap in React

run in terminal "npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3" . to get latest version go to "https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/"

// properits can be sent One folder js file to another folder by calling props that is Attributes in another folder.

Example === App.js --- Menubar.js(child of src) --- Test.js(child of src)
app.js --- <Menubar inCreament={counter} Decrement={decreCounter}

> </Menubar> (import Menubar from './Components/Menubar/Menubar';)

Menubar.js --- <Test Increasing={inCreament} decreasing =

{Decrement}></Test> (import Test from '../Tests/Test';)

Test.js ---<button className='ms-3 p-3' onClick={Increasing}>+</button>

    <button className='ms-3 p-3' onClick={decreasing}>-</button>

    /// NPM is a Package manager that works for run, start, play and functionals.NMP Is a full Package manager give us a Package with many features for Creating React APP.

     /// NPX--- Node Package Execute ,it comes with npm.It works together NPX and NPM.

    /// creat-react-app is a one type of command line interface for creating react APP.it give up huge facilities like npm start, run build.We find full setup by installing it.Such as mode_modules, .git , build, .gitignore , README.md, src folder with its files and other built-in itself.

    ///JSX(Javascript XML) html codes are written smoothly in js fil and js expressions are also written easily in html inside Curely brackets {}.So JSX is a syntectic sugar system.

    /// Unidirectional(One way binding) --- parent to child , and child to its  child sending data of the components.Like App.js ---to---allProduct.js ---- everyproduct.js(by properties/props)

    /// Usestate update value with the second array (like SetCount) it is asyncrounous system. First array(Count) will not execute the true value in function calling , it is updating as a asyncrounous.for getting the latest value instantly use --- useEffect or settimeInterval.State is updated asyncrounously.
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log(count)
    }, [count])

    /// calling the count arrray in dependency here [] -- we will get the latest value instantly.That means to get syncrounously must use useEffect for state.it change asyncrounous to syncrounous way.

     ## HOOK .
     It is  a special function of react to  implement react functionality to optimize codes. such as Usestate , useEffect, useref and other ".
     Usestate() count([first array]) can be sent to componen to component by Props.
     where found Usestate(), it callled be a statefull componet or Presentional component.

     /// " Be remember that props can not change/ read only but not write only"

     /// "REACT WORKS IN VIRTUAL DOM means that We want to change anything in components so, it becomes hard and tough. That's why React keeps a virtual DOM whenever want to change WE can do it easily".Think of your HTML code as a tree. In fact, that is exactly how the browser treats your DOM (your rendered HTML on the browser). React allows you to effectively re-construct your DOM in JavaScript and push only those changes to the DOM which have actually occurred.

     follow the link to understand easily  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-under-the-hood/

to wrap up, React will keep VIRTUAL DOM and Brower will have Brower DOM. React developer can change any thing easily in VIRTUAL DOM by creating a DOM to compare the Broweser DOM.in this, We need add "key" in tag.

## VIRTUAL DOM

it works here index.js file of src folder.

ReactDOM.render(
<React.StrictMode>
<App />
</React.StrictMode>,
document.getElementById('root')
);

<ul>
    <li key="A">A</li>
    <li key="B">B</li>
</ul> 
from it to change 
 <ul>
    <li key="Z">Z</li>
    <li key="A">A</li>
    <li key="B">B</li>
</ul>

## componet lifecycle.

     /// not found './' this while importing means that import from node odules.
     E.G. './products.css' it is custom designed by us not from node modules.
     node modules folder has a react folder name 'react' from where we find meny files for importing in react files.

          /// COMPONENT function WORKS can be Export default jsdk() and in the component I want to props the export component, must add in head import, import the file.

          /// we send the function/component like this.here no need to import anything from react

           export {Show, AnotherBrand, Myshow}

           parent function /component behaviour like this :

           import React from 'react';

import { AnotherBrand, Myshow, Show } from './CasualItems/Items';

const Cosmetics = () => {
let showBrand = 'Bata';
let showprice = 1790;  
 const reulst = Myshow(showBrand, showprice)
return (

<div>
<Show></Show> <br />
<AnotherBrand></AnotherBrand> <br />
<p>show information i s; ${reulst}</p>
</div> )};
export default Cosmetics;

/// Json generator follow the link https://json-generator.com/

/// creating a json file in public folder name.json means .json file, we can fetch it by locally.

/// to import file from many inner folders to parent folder ../../../../ we have go in this way. but same folder ./ that's it.

/// 3 way to access object suppose : var obj = {} --- obj.name, obj{'name'} and the other obj[id]

/// remeber that -- When the property name is dynamic or is not a valid identifier, a better alternative is square brackets property accessor: object[propertyName].

The first expression should evaluate to an object and the second expression should evaluate to a string denoting the property name.

Here's an example:

const property = 'name';
const hero = {
name: 'Batman'
};
// Square brackets property accessor:
hero['name']; // => 'Batman'
hero[property]; // => 'Batman'

## Json file

    WE have to keep the json file in public not src folder.Because We minified src files woked by us, we can't manipulate json file and take data clearly from src folder. that't why these kind of file must to store in Public folder.

### React components//

it is not possible to send data bottom to top in react , only send data top to bottom by "props" .
that's why to send data in Cart by clicking, Evenhandler have to be kept in Shop Component(main Component) that mean in useState and Useeffect and product.map() file from which collected data by props.Reason that : by clicking we need data from useState() function or useEffect(()=>{},[]). so we can keep evendhandler function bottom those.

/// We can only Send the parameter onclick button , and can call only the function name in props from which send the data to click button in another component.

### Destructer to destructer

first we took all props from its parent file useState(), UseEffect or product.map file, then we again destructer in the below system.

    const Product = (props) => {
    const {clickTo_addCart, allProducts} = props;
    const  {id ,name,seller,price,ratings,img} = allProducts

    /// more codes here in js file, but I have removed those as useless here,

}

## Array tricky to know

      const a = [1,4,7,9]


      (4) [1, 4, 7, 9]0: 11: 42: 73: 9length: 4[[Prototype]]: Array(0)

      [a]

    output //  [Array(4)]0: (4) [1, 4, 7, 9]0: 11: 42: 73: 9length: 4[[Prototype]]: Array(0)length: 1[[Prototype]]: Array(0)

      [...a,12,65]  only give the value and can add new array in this way

       output // (6) [1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 65]

## React-Font-awesome in 3 commands

npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome

write to import in header built in Function and Icon of React , must be import like below.then call the name to where to use.

    import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';

    import { faCoffee } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'

if clicking to a component want to change another component data, we have to use the click function in main project, then child component take data by props.

## Strategy to run of github clone project of react

/// Generally React Project(working project with src,build, .json and public) won't run(npm start) without its dependency and connected files like node module, installed font awsesome and dev tools.
That's why we need the project to drive in cmd (npm install). Then It will be an eligible to run localhost.
finally git clone project will be made qualified for run in localhost.#offTopic- to push my own repository to another like programming Hero's repo ,set this name git remote set-url origin https://github/................git.

// ToFixed() return a string decimal number , it requires the number to convert to parsefloat or + brfore variable;

## UseEffect why and what

Anything Loading from our code and UI design(code execute) is on my own, But UseEffect is a side affect that is loaded from outside of my codes and UI execution , like API , Json file or Local Storage or Database.

// Loading Data from Local Storage Database ,so Use UseEffect

     useEffect(()=>{
        const storedCartfromLocalStorage  = getStoredCart()

        console.log(storedCartfromLocalStorage);
    },[])

// to get data array of object [{},{},{}] , used (for of), but to get data from only Object not array , used (for in);

### Asynchronous vs sychronous

to get understand easily asynchronours and synchrouns it is best exaample from console.log in Emha-jon React Project(shop.js file)
line - data loading
Shop.js:21 Product load first before Fetch asynchronouesly

Shop.js:36 Local storage First Line Array(0)  // this array is empty due to dependency injection of [] after one time loaded, 
                                             it didn't value that's why empty . It was supposed to have 76 object Array(76)
Shop.js:47 Local storage last Line
Shop.js:10 Array(76)
Cart.js:5 Array(0)
Shop.js:25 Product load last line before Fetch asynchronouesly

useeffect(() {}, []) 

 [] if this dependency is empty array, only one time will be called while Loading Window Page , example is above.It.

 so, to get data after changing state(loading after loading) we must call that in [] inside this. then again again we will get value after changing.


## Lifting Up State -
Time to use Lift up the State: If the data in “parent and children components” or in “cousin components” is Not in Sync.

Example 1: If we have 2 components in our App. A -> B where, A is parent of B. keeping the same data in both Component A and B might cause inconsistency of data. 

Example 2: If we have 3 components in our App.

        A
       / \
      B   C
Where A is the parent of B and C. In this case, If there is some Data only in component B but, component C also wants that data. We know Component C cannot access the data because a component can talk only to its parent or child (Not cousins).

## When to create a new Component

***Similar In Look , But Different in Data is realized in app, then we have to create new Component.


 To set class in my own style , we set the class in parent components div like this 

   <div className='gunStyle'>
         {
        Guns.map(gun => 
           <Cart
          gunsInfo = {gun}
            key={gun.id}
           ></Cart> ) 
           }
      </div>


      // React Icon to use, follow This link  https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons

      and Icons documentation Link  https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons

      React one way data sending system (uni directional) that mean Parent to child, child to its child via props object

   API Fetch is a PROMISE , that mean it will not execute output as long as data is not found. As Asynchronours ,it delay to collect data, but next js programs of this fetch(with useEffect or not) does not wait for this.they start to launch before it.    so useState() we have to set initial state []  not to find undefined for this useEffect().to know more Programming Hero follow this Make A Simple React SPA. at 01:50 minutes  video https://web.programming-hero.com/conceptual-session .

    function can be called in two ways.
    1. <Header/> and 2. <Header> </Header>

    /// in state can't be pushed any data normally, it change the update data.so  romove this problem we have use spread operator to get old data like this.

    const [Carts, setCarts] = useState([])

    const handlecartToadd = (carWithParam)=> {
      const newGunCart = [...Carts , carWithParam];
      setCarts(newGunCart) }
  
Because, state has am empty array as an initial value. That's why at first it return array(0) , clicking one by one state change and pushing data old data by spread operator.

Moreover, object is enclosed [] to use map. originally the data is an object.

  output here .in every line below has object.

App.js:12 Array(0)

App.js:12 [{…}]     // conslone.log line number
 
App.js:12 (2) [{…}, {…}]

App.js:12 (3) [{…}, {…}, {…}]
